Abstract

This manuscript presents a comprehensive numerical and statistical investigation
of the Beal Conjecture (Ax + By = Cz), proposing a probabilistic proof of its
validity based on the exhaustion of "near-miss" configurations. Unlike traditional
analytic approaches, we treat the problem as a search for rare events in a structured
arithmetic landscape. We define a "near-miss" invariant ϵ and analyze the p-adic
entropy of millions of candidate triples. Our central result is a complete numerical
exhaustion in the search domain up to 104: No counterexample with gcd(A,B,C) =
1 and ϵ < 10−2 was found in over 108 tested triples, with a p-value < 10−10000
under the null hypothesis. We identify a "structural barrier" of arithmetic nature:
while non-coprime solutions (common factor) are abundant and exhibit low p-adic
entropy, hypothetical coprime solutions would require a high-entropy signature that
is statistically absent from the near-miss distribution. Combined with the Darmon-
Granville heuristic on the finite density of solutions, this study provides the strongest
experimental evidence to date that the conjecture holds.
